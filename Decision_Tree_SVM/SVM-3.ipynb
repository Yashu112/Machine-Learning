In MSE and RMSE, the squared differences between predicted and actual values can give disproportionately high weight to outliers, leading to inflated error values. In contrast, MAE treats all errors (including those from outliers) equally, providing a more robust measure of prediction accuracy.\n",

When we have calculated both Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and found that both values are very close, it suggests that the choice of metric may not significantly impact your evaluation in this particular case. Both MSE and RMSE are closely related, with RMSE being the square root of MSE.

    "Ans. If our goal is to measure how well the SVM regression models explain the variance in the target variable, the most appropriate evaluation metric to use is the coefficient of determination, often denoted as R-squared (R²). R-squared quantifies the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. Here's why R-squared is suitable for this purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Measuring Explained Variance**: R-squared provides a clear indication of the amount of variance in the target variable that is captured by the model. A higher R-squared value indicates that a larger proportion of the variance is explained by the model, which suggests a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpretability**: R-squared is easily interpretable. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means that the model does not explain any variance, and 1 means that the model perfectly explains all of the variance. This makes it easy to understand and compare the explanatory power of different models.\n",
